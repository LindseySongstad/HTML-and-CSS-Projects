		<br>'Hope' is the thing with feathers—
		<br>That perches in the soul—
		<br>And sings the tune without the words—
		<br>And never stops &nbsp; at all—
		<br>
		<br>And sweetest—in the Gale—is heard—
		<br>And sore must be the storm—
		<br>That could abash the little Bird
		<br>That kept so many warm—
		<br>
		<br>I've heard it in the chillest land—
		<br>And on the strangest Sea—
		<br>Yet, never, in Extremity,
		<br>It asked a crumb &nbsp;of Me.
